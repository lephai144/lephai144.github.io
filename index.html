                <h6>The hamburger first appeared in the 19th or early 20th century</h6>
                <h6>The modern hamburger was a product of the culinary needs of a society rapidly changing</h6>
                <h6>due to industrialization and the emergence of the working class and middle class</h6>
                <h6>with the resulting demand for mass-produced,</h6>
                <h6>affordable food that could be consumed outside of the home.</h6>
                <h6>Considerable evidence suggests the USA was the first country where two slices of bread</h6>
                <h6>and a ground beef steak were combined into a "hamburger sandwich" and sold.</h6>
                <h6>There is some controversy over the origin of the hamburger because its two basic ingredients,</h6>
                <h6>bread and beef, had been prepared and consumed separately for many years in different</h6>
                <h6>countries before their combination.</h6>
                <h6>Shortly after its creation, the hamburger quickly included all of its currently</h6>
                <h6>typically characteristic trimmings, including onions, lettuce, and sliced pickles.</h6>
                <h6>It is named after the German city of Hamburg.</h6>
